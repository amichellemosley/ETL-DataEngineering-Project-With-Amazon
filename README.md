# ETL-DataEngineering-Project-With-Amazon
Configured a scrapy project, scraped amazon's best seller webpage. Crawled and extracted the names &amp; prices for the top 50 items on that page. Transformed the data into a .csv file. Results stored in the spider folder of the project (amazonelectronicsinfo.csv). Lightweight pipeline and middleware configuration based on spider needs.
